            Poetry is everywhere. It’s in the air we breathe, it’s in the
            rustling of the trees, it’s in streets of a city, and it’s in every
            corner of the universe; every place known and unknown to man. We are
            all poets. Some of us may not be through words, but through our
            actions and thoughts. So here are 50 poems from a book I’ll probably
            never publish entitled “Box Of Chocolates” As we pick through milk
            chocolate, white chocolate, and dark chocolate, we also get a taste
            of the essence of life, the lightness of love, and the sorrow of
            heartbreak: PART I: DARK CHOCOLATE

            Verse Poem.) - Poem by J.A McManus Autoplay next video From the pit
            of my coldness You burn me with acid-filled glares Like I am nothing
            but garbage left to go stale Out here I have no shelter from the
            rain. I wander hungrily through familiar streets Looking for
            somewhere to belong I am labelled as a leper amongst the sick For
            you do not want to see or hear my pain. As I stand in the doorway of
            my despair I watch the world from it’s shadows I have become a
            phantom with no hope For I have ran out of people to blame.{" "}
